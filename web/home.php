            <h1>About Camden</h1>
            <p>Hello, I'm Camden. I like retro games. 
                Arcade, DOS, Atari and SNES are among my favorites. I'll be the first to admit that many of the games  
                I'm not very good at but I sincerely enjoy the byte limitations and art and sounds that had to be created 
                for each game. I guess I'm more of an enthusiast. My favorite way to play these games is with my raspberry pi 
                fitted with the latest Retro Pi open project. Projects like these is what got me into coding. I created my own game 
                based around the ideas of the games I so enjoy (simple yet fun) here's the link to <a href='http://d8dt.com/DinoApp/bennyAndTheStick.html'>Jonny & the Stick</a>
